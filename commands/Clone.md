# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can yse the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original respository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote
```
